# RAI

**An AI due-diligence copilot for utility-scale solar projects.**

Upload a location and a pile of project documents. RAI runs a pipeline of
specialist agents over them and returns a scored readiness report: what the
documents contradict, what they never covered, what the public record says
instead, and the exact work product needed to close the gaps.

## The problem

A utility-scale solar project arrives at an investment committee as a dossier —
feasibility study, interconnection correspondence, offtake terms, a financial
model, permitting memos, environmental surveys. Hundreds of pages, assembled
over months by different parties, and internally inconsistent by the time it
lands.

Two things make this expensive:

**1. The red flags live between documents, not inside them.** Every individual
document is self-consistent and professionally produced. The problem is that the
financial model assumes $186M CAPEX while the materials quote says $199–211M;
that the offtake term sheet contracts 200 MW while the executed agreements cover
150; that the grading schedule starts before environmental review closes. No
single reviewer reading one document at a time catches these. Finding them means
holding every quantified claim in the package against every other one.

**2. A thin dossier looks the same as a complete one.** What is *absent* — no
bankable P50 irradiance study, no title evidence for site control, no queue
position — does not announce itself. It has to be audited against what a full
diligence package is supposed to contain, then chased down from public sources
before anyone can tell whether the gap is a paperwork delay or a dead deal.

Done by hand, that is weeks of senior analyst time per project — and deals move
on tax-credit deadlines that do not wait. RAI compresses it to a single run and
shows its work: every finding is cited back to the document or public source it
came from.

## Architecture

### The pipeline

One run fans out across specialist agents, each with a narrow prompt, a tool
whitelist, and a typed output contract. `agent_backend/pipeline.py`:

```

Cross-examination is the point of the product. Everything upstream exists to
give it a complete, citable set of facts to reconcile; everything downstream
turns what it finds into work someone can action.

### The agent loop

Every agent — all nine roles — runs the same loop in `agents/base.py`:

> plan → call tool → observe → repeat, until it emits JSON that validates
> against its contract.

- **No free-text handoffs.** Each role declares a Pydantic contract
  (`schemas.py`). Invalid output is fed back with the error and retried, not
  passed downstream. `MAX_STEPS` bounds the loop; failing to converge raises
  rather than returning something plausible.
- **Tools are whitelisted per role** (`agents/roles.py`). The doc extractor
  cannot search the web; the analyst answering questions about a finished report
  cannot execute code. A call outside the whitelist is traced as a warning, not
  silently honored.
- **Arithmetic is executed, not imagined.** The cross-examiner and scorer are
  instructed to write Python and run it for unit conversions and weighted
  scores. A readiness number that disagrees with its own dimension scores is the
  one error the scorer cannot make.
- **Provider is switchable.** `LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic` calls Claude directly
  through the Anthropic SDK (adaptive thinking, configurable effort);
  `LLM_PROVIDER=openai` routes the same loop through any OpenAI-compatible
  endpoint.

### Isolation

Model-generated code runs in a **Daytona** microVM, never on the host. Each
agent run provisions one sandbox up front, reuses it across that agent's tool
calls, and tears it down in a `finally` — so a crashed run cannot leak a box.
Egress is deny-by-default: the sandbox carries model credentials so agents can
call the model from inside it, and the allow-list is what stops generated code
from posting those credentials anywhere else.

With no `DAYTONA_API_KEY`, `sandbox_run` **refuses to execute** rather than
falling back to running generated code on the host.

> **Current gap:** the per-agent sandbox and the tracing below are wired into
> the Anthropic path. The OpenAI-compatible path (`LLM_PROVIDER=openai`, the
> present default) runs its own loop and is not yet instrumented — no spans, no
> sandbox session.

### Observability

Every phase, LLM call, tool call, and sandbox operation is a timed span
(`obs.py`). One `Trace` per job, and its sink pushes structured events onto the
same queue the SSE endpoint drains — so the dashboard's live narration and the
server console show the same activity, and `GET /api/jobs/{id}/trace` replays
the whole run afterwards. "The agent is slow" and "Daytona took 8s to
provision" are meant to be distinguishable. Anything shaped like a credential is
masked at the sink, since traces get pasted into issues and shown in demos.

### Frontend contract

The dashboard talks to the backend over plain HTTP plus one SSE stream:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/uploads` | multipart dossier upload |
| `POST /api/projects/analyze` | start a run, returns `jobId` immediately |
| `GET /api/jobs/{id}/stream` | SSE narration while the pipeline runs |
| `GET /api/reports/{id}` | the finished report |
| `POST /api/reports/{id}/ask` | grounded Q&A against a finished report |
| `GET /api/projects` | portfolio view, worst readiness first |
| `GET /api/health` · `/api/health/sandbox` | dependency and sandbox self-test |

`frontend/src/lib/agent/adapter.ts` converts an `AgentReport` into the UI's
`ProjectDetail` shape. A Python twin (`agent_backend/sentinel_adapter.py`)
produces identical output and is parity-locked in CI. When the backend is
unreachable the UI degrades to mock data rather than crashing.

## Running it

```bash
# backend
pip install -r agent_backend/requirements.txt
cp agent_backend/.env.example agent_backend/.env    # fill in keys
set -a && source agent_backend/.env && set +a
uvicorn agent_backend.main:app --reload --port 8000

# frontend
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

The frontend defaults to `http://localhost:8000`; override with
`NEXT_PUBLIC_AGENT_API`. Without a backend it runs on mock data.

Required: a model key (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, or `LLM_API_KEY` for the
OpenAI-compatible bridge). Optional: `DAYTONA_API_KEY` for sandboxed execution,
`TAVILY_API_KEY` for live web research. See `agent_backend/.env.example` for the
full set.
